      "content": "Understanding Our Relationship with a Complex Material. How has plastic changed our lives, and what does our relationship with it reveal about our world? Plastic has transformed how we live, making products more affordable, accessible, and convenient. Yet this remarkable material has created one of our most urgent environmental challenges. In Uganda, approximately 600 tons of plastic waste is generated daily in Kampala alone, with only about 6% being properly recycled. Meanwhile, South Africa produces about 2.4 million tons of plastic waste annually, with recycling rates hovering around 14%.",

      "content": "Introduction to Circular Economy Thinking. How might we transform our \"take-make-waste\" approach to create systems where plastic never becomes waste? Our current economic system largely follows a linear model: we extract resources, make products, and discard them as waste. This \"take-make-waste\" approach assumes infinite resources and somewhere to put our growing mountains of waste—assumptions our planet can no longer support. The circular economy offers a different vision. It mimics natural systems where nothing is wasted—one organism's waste becomes another's food.",

When we look at environmental challenges like plastic pollution, we often focus only on what's immediately visible—the plastic bottle on the beach, the clogged drainage ditch, or the overflowing waste bin. But these visible problems are just the \"tip of the iceberg.\" Beneath the surface lie the patterns, structures, and mindsets that keep creating these problems, even when we try to address the symptoms.",

In environmental work, breakthrough solutions often come when we question what everyone takes for granted.",
